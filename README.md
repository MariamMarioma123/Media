Using JAVA, we implemented the following image operations in a separate method as follows:
<br>1. void brighten(I, v)  where I is the image itself represented as a 2D array
and v is the value that you need to brighten your image accordingly. Your
output should display the values of the pixels in the image along with
showing the image itself.
<br>2. void darken(I, v)  where I is the image itself represented as a 2D array
and v is the value that you need to darken your image accordingly. Your
output should display the values of the pixels in the image along with
showing the image itself.
<br>3. void inverse(I)  where I is the image itself represented as a 2D array. Your
output should display the values of the pixels in the image along with
showing the image itself. The inverse operation can be applied according to
the following graph:
<br>4. void avgfilter(I, s)  where I is the image itself represented as a 2D array
and s is the size of the filter for example, 3 x 3 or 5 x 5. This method
performs average filter of size s x s on the image I. Your output should
display the values of the pixels in the image along with showing the image
itself.
<br>5. void unisharpfilter(I, s)  where I is the image itself represented as a 2D
array and s is the size of the filter for example, 3 x 3 or 5 x 5. This method
performs uniform sharpening filter of size s x s on the image I. Your output
should display the values of the pixels in the image along with showing the
image itself.
